## Python Battleship ##
## by Jos√© Flores

## In battleship there are 5 ships: 
##   Ship Name   |   Size
##    Carrier    |    5
##   Battleship  |    4
##    Cruiser    |    3
##   Submarine   |    3
##   Destroyer   |    2

## These ships can be arranged either horizontally or vertically, without overlapping
## This game will let you play versus an "AI" (although not really, not using any AI-related algorithms)
## You will choose where to place your ships, the computer's will be placed randomly, according to the rules.
## You will have a board with your ships, where you can track where the computer has attacked
## You will also have a "tracking" board, to keep track of where you have attacked
